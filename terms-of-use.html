If that dispute resolution provision does not apply or does not exist, then you and Company agree to resolve any such disputes according to the Dispute Resolution for Non-Subscribers provision below. </p>
<h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-SUBSCRIBERS: BINDING ARBITRATION</h4>
<p>Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
<h6>Summary:</h6>
<p>Most disputes can be resolved informally. If you have a concern, please contact us. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concern to your satisfaction (or if we haven’t been able to resolve a dispute that we have with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve disputes arising out of your use of the Website through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision, and in making it you should not rely solely on the information in this agreement. You may opt out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.</p> 
<h6>Arbitration Agreement:</h6>
<p>(1) We and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us arising out of your use of the Website. This provision does not apply to other disputes or claims that may arise, such as claims relating to use of our products or claims arising out of another agreement between us, in which case the terms of that agreement would apply. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and expressly includes claims brought under any statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
<li>Claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
<li>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you aren't a member of a certified class; and</li>
<li>Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li></ul>
References to "you", "we", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior agreements between us. 
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if your claims are within that court’s jurisdiction and are pending only in that court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. </p>
<p>(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to us should be addressed to: [HB Ideas, LLC, 8250 Westpark Dr Apt 802, Mc Lean, VA, 22102] ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If we and you don't reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. </p> 
<p>(3) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures, and when applicable the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879. </p>
<p>The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision. Unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Fairfax County, VA. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. </p>
<p>(4) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. </p>
<p>(5) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of these Terms of Use, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you're agreeing that you'll arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with this provision.</p>
<p>(6) HOW TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION: You may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending a letter to the Notice Address referenced above, and providing each of the following pieces of information: (a) your full name; (b) your address; (c) your phone number; (d) the URL where you found this agreement; and (e) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision. This opt-out notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept these Terms of Use.</p>
<h4>Waiver and Severability</h4>
<p>No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. </p>
<h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, and any applicable Subscriber Agreement constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and HB Ideas, LLC regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website. </p>
